### Data

This session uses the **"John Snow's Cholera map""** dataset. Go to the
[Datasets](../datasets.html) tab to find out more information as well as instructions to
download it.

### Additional materials

* The ["Spatial Autocorrelation"](http://pysal.readthedocs.org/en/latest/users/tutorials/autocorrelation.html) in `PySAL`'s documentation is a good extension to the topics covered in this session. It illustrates other statistics beyond those covered in class, albeit it does so in a more advanced fashion.
